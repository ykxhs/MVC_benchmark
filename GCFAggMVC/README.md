## 1. Framework

The overall framework. Our module includes global and cross-view feature aggregation module (GCFAgg) and structure-guided multiview contrastive learning module (SgCL). 
The former learns a consensus representation via considering global structure relationship among samples, which fully explores the complementary of similar samples. 
The latter integrates the learnt global structure relationship and consensus representation to contrastive learning, which makes data representations in the same cluster similar and addresses the aforementioned second issue in the introduction. 
Note that, EC: Encoder; DC: Decoder; Cat:Concatenation; MLP: Multi-Layer Perception.

## 2.Requirements

pytorch==1.12.1

numpy>=1.21.6

scikit-learn>=1.0.2

## 3.Datasets

The Synthetic3d, Prokaryotic, and MNIST-USPS datasets are placed in "data" folder. The others dataset could be downloaded from [cloud](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1XNWW8UqTcPMkw9NpiKqvOQ). key: data

## 4.Usage

The code includes:

- an example for train a new modelï¼š

```bash
python run.py
```

- an example  for test the trained model:

```bash
python test.py
```

You can get the following output:

```bash
Epoch 290 Loss:15.420288
Epoch 291 Loss:15.431067
Epoch 292 Loss:15.417261
Epoch 293 Loss:15.436375
Epoch 294 Loss:15.398655
Epoch 295 Loss:15.406467
Epoch 296 Loss:15.413018
Epoch 297 Loss:15.419146
Epoch 298 Loss:15.419894
Epoch 299 Loss:15.389602
Epoch 300 Loss:15.377309
